In the analysis and preprocessing of air quality data with Pandas, the process begins by creating a data frame of complete cases and finding the mean temperature using listwise deletion, alongside determining the mean temperature via pairwise deletion. Identification of rows containing missing temperature values facilitates understanding the extent of missing data. Subsequently, a box plot for temperature data is created, revealing potential skewness as indicated by the difference between median and mean values. Missing solar radiation values are imputed with the median, while missing temperature values are filled with the mean temperature for each respective month. Ozone values are imputed using ratio imputation based on the now complete temperature column, followed by the use of linear regression with ozone as the independent variable to impute missing wind values. Finally, a check for missing values across all columns ensures comprehensive data integrity.
